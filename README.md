## 📘 Example Project: Iris Classification

This notebook demonstrates a simple and fully explainable Machine Learning workflow using the Iris dataset.

### 🔹 Steps Covered
- Load dataset (Iris)
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train two models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Compare model accuracy
- Plot confusion matrix
- Show classification report

### 🔹 Why this project?
The Iris dataset is widely used in machin learning education and research.
it is clean , balanced , and ideal for demonstrating:

- Core ML fundamentals
- Classification workflows 
- Evaluation metrics  
- Model comparison techniques 
- A complete end-to-end pipeline (preprocessing -training- evaluation) 

### 🔹 File
