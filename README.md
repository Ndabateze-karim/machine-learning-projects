## 📘 Example Project: Iris Classification

This notebook demonstrates a simple and fully explainable Machine Learning workflow using the Iris dataset.

### 🔹 Steps Covered
- Load dataset (Iris)
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Train two models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Compare model accuracy
- Plot confusion matrix
- Show classification report

### 🔹 Why this project?
The Iris dataset is clean, widely used, and perfect for showing:
- ML fundamentals  
- Evaluation metrics  
- Model comparison  
- A complete pipeline that is easy to explain in interviews  

### 🔹 File
