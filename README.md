## 📘 Example Project: Housing Price Regression

This notebook presents a supervised regression workflow using the California Housing dataset.  
The goal is to predict housing prices based on socioeconomic and geographic features.

### 🔹 Steps Covered
- Load dataset (California Housing)
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train two regression models:
  - Linear Regression (baseline model)
  - Random Forest Regressor (non-linear model)
- Evaluate models using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score
- Compare performance across models
- Visualize feature importance using Random Forest

### 🔹 Why this project?

This dataset is widely used for demonstrating regression techniques in real-world scenarios.
